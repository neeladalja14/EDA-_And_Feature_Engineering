# 💰 Loan Eligibility Prediction

Welcome to the **Loan Eligibility Prediction** project! 🏦📊

## 📌 About This Project
Wondering if a loan application will be approved? This project leverages **machine learning** to analyze key factors like income, credit history, and loan amount to predict eligibility. 🏡💳

## 🔍 What’s Inside?
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering 🧹🔧
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying key trends in loan approvals 📊
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc. 🤖
- **Model Evaluation**: Checking accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC ✅

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Input**: Loan applicant details (income, loan amount, credit history, etc.) 📝
2. **Processing**: Feature selection, scaling, encoding categorical variables 🔄
3. **Model Training**: Machine learning models predict loan eligibility 🤓
4. **Prediction**: Approve or reject the loan application 🎯
